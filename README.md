# kvpk

key-value for private key

A [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) that allows a private
key, typically associated with a blockchain wallet, to store arbitrary data in a
KV store. Like most blockchains, **all data is publicly available.** This is
_not_ a secure storage solutionâ€”only write access is authenticated.

It uses the [PFPK](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/pfpk) auth service as its
authentication layer, which lets users manage unique profiles with one or more
public key authorized to access them. PFPK generates a UUID (universally unique
identifier) for each profile, which KVPK associates key-value pairs with.

To look up a value for a given public key or blockchain address, use
[PFPK's profile retrieval endpoint](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/pfpk?tab=readme-ov-file#get-publickey)
to resolve the profile's UUID, and then look it up here.

## API

Request and response bodies are encoded via JSON.

### Authentication

1. Create a token with the PFPK auth service.

   The token must have this service's hostname (probably `kvpk.daodao.zone`) as
   the audience, and `admin` as the role.

   See the [PFPK auth service
   docs](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/pfpk?tab=readme-ov-file#post-tokens) for more
   information.

2. Set a bearer token in the `Authorization` header, like: `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN`.

### `POST /set`

Set the `Authorization` header to the PFPK auth token as described above.

Set a key-value pair in the KV store. Set `value` to `null` to delete a key. Any
other value will be stored and returned identically.

#### Request

```ts
{
  "key": string
  "value": any | null
}
```

#### Response

A 204 No Content response is returned on success.

### `POST /setMany`

Set the `Authorization` header to the PFPK auth token as described above.

Set many key-value pairs in the KV store. Set `value` to `null` to delete a key.
Any other value will be stored and returned identically.

#### Request

```ts
{
  "items": {
    "key": string
    "value": any | null
  }[]
}
```

#### Response

A 204 No Content response is returned on success.

### `POST /arrayInsert`

Set the `Authorization` header to the PFPK auth token as described above.

Insert a value into an array, creating the array if it doesn't exist. If `index`
is provided, the value is inserted at the given index. If `index` is not
provided, the value is appended to the end of the array.

#### Request

```ts
{
  "key": string
  "value": any
  "index": number | undefined
}
```

#### Response

The new array is returned.

```ts
{
  "key": string
  "value": any
}
```

### `POST /arrayRemove`

Set the `Authorization` header to the PFPK auth token as described above.

Remove a value from an array at the given index.

#### Request

```ts
{
  "key": string
  "index": number
}
```

#### Response

The new array is returned.

```ts
{
  "key": string
  "value": any
}
```

### `GET /get/:uuid/:key`

No authentication is required.

Get a value for a UUID and key. `uuid` is the UUID of the user's profile from
the PFPK auth service.

#### Response

```ts
{
  "key": string
  "value": any | null
}
```

### `GET /list/:uuid/:prefix`

No authentication is required.

List keys with a prefix for a given UUID. `uuid` is the UUID of the user's
profile from the PFPK auth service.

#### Response

```ts
{
  "items": Array<{
    "key": string
    "value": any
  }>
}
```

### `GET /reverse/:key`

No authentication is required.

Get the list of UUIDs and values that have a given key set.

#### Response

```ts
{
  "items": Array<{
    "uuid": string
    "value": any
  }>
}
```
